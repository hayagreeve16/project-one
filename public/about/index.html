				<p>A strong believer in the superiority of the electric drive, Tarun started working on EV battery packs to solve one of the biggest pain points with EVs in India. However, realization soon dawned that the problem wasn’t limited to batteries alone and that the entire vehicle needed to be designed from ground-up to produce an intuitive and smart EV. Thus, Ather Energy was born.</p>

				<p>After building his first functional car in his 12th grade with second hand parts and scrap, he realized the exhilaration of driving a self-made vehicle. That experience then triggered a pursuit of all things automotive - from building and leading the FSAE team of IIT madras (Raftar), to racing at the Hockenheimring F1 circuit, Germany and working on many industry projects.</p>

				<p>He strongly believes in the “Less is more” approach to engineering, and is paranoid about any extra weight. Lightweight construction is as much an art as it is engineering and reducing that extra gram is a big turn on.</p> 

				<p>The most intriguing part of automotive engineering for Arun is that there is no right and no wrong. It’s all just one big optimization.</p>

The performance of the motor, display, shock absorbers are configured according to the person who has signed in during the start of the vehicle.</p>

Like any component design in an automobile, safe and sturdy operation are the driving factors in design. It is the energy core of an EV.

Vehicle Dynamics of Independent Four Wheel Steering Vehicles and he was the Technical Lead of 

the Vehicle Dynamics Software team at Altair Engineering before joining Ather.

He is still actively involved with Baja Student India and Formula Student India as the 'Head of the

He is a big fan of XKCD comics and in his free times likes to apply Logic, Math and Physics to things 

that may not deserve its rigor.</p>	">
